# Stickies
A Sticky Note program made by me, in Python, from scratch!

Change Log:
1.0 - Start of project
2.0 - editing things, as well as 2.0 brought a re-write of how the main part of the program worked
2.1 - Added ... stuff ... I don't quite remember
2.2 - Focuses on [attempting and failing at] adding scaling of text and icons/images (zoom) to make small text easier to read.
2.3 - At this point I give up and decide to switch to using tkinter for graphics handling, and had the side effetcs of fixing MANY future problems and adding some cool new future possible functionality (more on that later)
2.4 - Focuses on continuing to implement tkinter and adding functionality. This includes shortcuts, themes, and icons changes.
2.5 - Fixed asset icons (even though they weren't being used at this version) and adjusting useability and user-friendliness.

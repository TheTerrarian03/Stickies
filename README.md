# Stickies
A Sticky Note program made by me, in Python, mostly from scratch!

How to use:
  To use the most recent version of Stky, download the code (and unzip the file if neccessary) to wherever you want to save it to. Then, open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to where the folder is saved. Then go into the "Current/" folder, and run the command "python3 main.py" (You have to already have python 3.x intalled). From there, you will have a starter sticky that you can edit. You will notice the menus at the top, and each menu has commands you can click to do things like Save, Make A New Sticky, Open a Save, Rename the Sticky Save, change the Theme of the Sticky, etc. Need more help?

NOTE:
  More ease-of-use in terms of simply opening the program will hopefully come soon (so you'll no longer have to use the terminal to open Stky :D)!

Change Log:
1.0 - Start of project
2.0 - editing things, as well as 2.0 brought a re-write of how the main part of the program worked
2.1 - Added ... stuff ... I don't quite remember
2.2 - Focuses on [attempting and failing at] adding scaling of text and icons/images (zoom) to make small text easier to read.
2.3 - At this point I give up and decide to switch to using tkinter for graphics handling, and had the side effetcs of fixing MANY future problems and adding some cool new future possible functionality (more on that later)
2.4 - Focuses on continuing to implement tkinter and adding functionality. This includes shortcuts, themes, and icons changes.
2.5 - Fixed asset icons (even though they weren't being used at this version) and adjusting useability and user-friendliness.
2.6 - Bug fixing, Menu feature adding, and some File cleanup

{"TITLE": "Thoughts 09212021", "THEME": "DARK", "CONTENT": "Thoughts - 09212021\\n\\nIntro:\\n\tI'm feel so depressed right now, and I don't know why. If I knew why the hell I feel like that I'd be explaining it right now, but I honestly just don't know. I guess since I don't know, I'm just going to blame it on the entire situation with my family right now. Yes, my Dad just bought a house in the neighborhood of my girlfriend and in the same district as my school and other friends (of the few I have), so that's exctiting and something to look forward to... but it's tuesday and tomorrow I go back to my Mother's place, and I'm dreading it. I don't want to go back. It's too far from my Dad, friends, and even the general area I call Home.\\n\\nSome problems:\\n\tThe situation at home is really bringing me down and it's lately starting to really get to me- the fact that my parents are split, the fact that I have two different places to live (though by November I'll have much more of a Home than the apartments I'm in right now, so that's wonderful), the fact that my mother isn't being there for her children like she should be. Aobut that last part: I say this because Nova is SIX, and when she has to go through something this impactful is just, frankly, fucked up. The fact that my mother has to send Dad voice recordings so that Nova thinks that mother is still there for her, when really alllllllll of this could have been EASILY avoided if it just never happened in the first place. It's beyond stupid that Nova throws fits everytime she parent hops (and despite my mother saying I shouldn't call it that but whatever) because she doens't want to go back to whatever the next place is- she gets attached.\\n\\nSchool isn't helping:\\n\tWell it IS helping, but at the same time it's not. How it IS helping: It's a temporary, 6.5-hour break from shit at home. It's a place to get away, a place to forget and just learn things. It's a distraction. How is ISN'T helping: It sucks. I hate biology because it's so boring and I just don't like the subject. I'm also in Robotics Club, that meets after school. Sure, while it's a another 2 hours of a break from the stuff that's going on at home, it's 2 hours of collaborating with people I barely know, and I'm not a people person nor am I that great at working with people. A small group of 2-3 other people? Sure, I can do that. But about 20 total people at the most? HahahaHAHAHWHAHHAHDAWAHHWHDAWHK no. The bright\\n"}

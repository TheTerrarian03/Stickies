{"TITLE": "What Do You Think About Me?", "THEME": "YELLOW", "CONTENT": "One of the recent topics we were talking about had to do with rape and trauma- you know what I'm talking about. Whenever it's brought up, I always try by best to be as supportive as I can be, but most of the time I don't know what to say or what to think about some of the stuff. I put together the information and knowledge I have and think of any way I can be supportive and agree with you. Do I fully understand what's going on all the time? No. But I try my best.\\n\\nWhy am I mentioning this? Becuase I think about you a lot. I know it sounds cheesy at first, but it's not always good thoughts. Most of it's good, of course, but some of it's not-so-good, as in I worry about you a lot. I have never thought bad about you, NEVER. You have never made me mad, you have never annoyed me, and you have never bothered me at all. So what do I worry about, then? Well, I worry about what kind of things you think about me, possibly.\\n\\nThe reason I said what I said in the first paragraph is because I want you to know how I mostly feel about that topic and what my thought process on handling it is. Ok, enough fluff, here it is: I worry about whether you think about if I would do something to you like what's happened before to you. I worry about if you think I'm just gaining your trust so I can go and turn around and sabotage you later and do bad things to you. It worries me, because it's not something I would ever want to do to someone, and I would never even think about doing.\\n\\nIt's also the reason I ask if you want me to do something before I do it. If it's something other than things that people do everyday like a hug, kiss on the cheek, or a hand-holding, I'll always ask (within reason, of course. If there are things we've agreed on then I won't ask, but you know what I mean). For example: A few times ago when we were spooing on your bed and I asked if you wanted me to 'massage your boob' because you said you liked it, and you replied with \"You don't have to ask\". Well, I will anyways, because I know it's possible to have a day wen you're just not in that kind of mood, and making you upset or surprised (not in a good way) is not something that I want to do.\\n"}

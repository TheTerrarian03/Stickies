{"TITLE": "MyLoveByRiley", "THEME": "YELLOW", "CONTENT": "Logan,\n\n    In the months I\u2019ve had the pleasure of getting to know you, I can 100% say without a shadow of a doubt that I\u2019m extremely glad that I\u2019ve gotten to know you as well as I do now. I adore you. I love the time I get to spend with you, and I enjoy every single second I\u2019m able to share with you. I simply adore you. There\u2019s no doubt about it. You\u2019re the only boy I\u2019ve gotten close to in years and you\u2019re among the very few boys I\u2019ve trusted in a long time. In the nearly 8 months that we\u2019ve gotten to know each other, I\u2019ve noticed a number of things about you and I. Seeing as you were/are relatively quiet at school, I- admittedly- didn\u2019t really notice that you were there. Granted, I hung out with people whom didn\u2019t know you and we never shared classes together, but I always felt bad that I didn\u2019t get to know you more. \n\n    Knowing how you now, I\u2019m kicking myself in the foot for not reaching out sooner. Honestly, you\u2019ve made my entire world a whole lot brighter. Food tastes a bit better, the Sun\u2019s a little brighter, and everything feels a whole lot better now that you\u2019re in my life. Even as friends, I\u2019d go home feeling happy because I got to talk and have fun with you, which was rare. I thoroughly enjoy every waking (and asleep) moment I spend with you. I can see so many things in better ways now that you\u2019re in my life. Cheesy, I know, but I\u2019m nothing if not honest. \n\n    For years, I\u2019ve avoided people- even before what happened with Christian- simply because I\u2019m introverted when I\u2019m not with people I know. Coming from a big-city kid, that\u2019s kinda rare. Seeing and meeting someone like me brought me out of the rut I found myself in over the last year-and-a-half following COVID and some other issues. When Cas died, I became a shell of who I used to be. I was quiet, reserved, and isolated. Whilst moving here has helped (and made things worse) knowing that there\u2019s someone like you genuinely caring about me has kicked me out of the shadows. Before, I\u2019d never leave my house. I\u2019d only leave to go to Chloe\u2019s, school, or dragged out by my parents. Now, it feels like I can do so much more because I want to take you places that mean so much to me. Even in this small town (city?) there\u2019s plenty to see. \n\n    I love you. I love you so much, it hurts my chest every single time we\u2019re apart. I don\u2019t want anything bad happening to you. Even it\u2019s small, I don\u2019t want anything happening to you. I don\u2019t wish harm on anyone- other than a select few- and I certainly don\u2019t wish anything on you. You\u2019re the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me, and that\u2019s a simple fact. I love you. I want to be with you. God, the amount of times I\u2019ve thought that I wanted to just stop living would be overwhelming, but you\u2019re something I live for. You keep me going. You keep me from falling back into old habits that destroyed who I was. And I thank you for that. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for that. \n\n    For nearly 8 months, you\u2019ve helped me time and time again. Whether it be with panic/anxiety attacks, being triggered, or simply me being a dark headspace. You\u2019ve been by my side and I couldn\u2019t be more thankful. I don\u2019t know how you do it, but you put up with me. At any point at any time, you can walk away. I\u2019d understand. You can walk away and never talk to me again, and I\u2019d understand 100%. There are times where I\u2019ve wanted to walk away from myself because I simply can\u2019t stand many things about myself. Even then, I always come back because there\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel: You. You are my light. You are the high in my noon. The stars to my night sky. The North to my South. You are my everything. You are my world. And I couldn\u2019t be happier than I am with you. \n\n    I love you, Logan Scott Meyers. I love you. I have always loved you. I will always love you, no matter what. Rain or shine, day or night, I will always love you. We may have our ups and downs, our arguments, but- mark my word- I will always love you. That\u2019s not a threat. It\u2019s a promise. I, Riley Marie Seigerman, will always love you. I love you so much, Babes, never forget that. If you do or don\u2019t- doesn\u2019t matter- I\u2019ll always remind you. \n\nYour Sappy Girlfriend, \nRiley Seigerman\n\n"}
